# 🏠 Bangalore Home Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using machine learning.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Built a **regression model** to predict home prices based on features like location, total square feet area, number of bathrooms, and BHK (bedroom-hall-kitchen).
- Performed **data cleaning** (handling missing values, removing outliers, fixing inconsistencies).
- Used **feature engineering** techniques such as one-hot encoding for location.
- Trained and evaluated the model using **Linear Regression** and tested performance with metrics like R² score.
- Deployed a trained model as a `.pkl` file for reuse.
